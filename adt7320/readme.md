=== ADT7320 coding exercise ===

This really does not belong in the MCU project, but the MCU project is
the most convenient place for me to put it, since the ashmanskas/mcu
github repo is the place we have been using to get additional people up
to speed with Verilog coding for FPGAs for the BPET project.

What we will develop in this directory is a Verilog state machine to
read out the 4-wire SPI interface of the ADT7320 temperature monitor
chip, which on the ROCSTAR board is controlled by the Microzed.
