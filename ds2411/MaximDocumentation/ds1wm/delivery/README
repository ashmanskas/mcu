This delivery package contains synthesizable VHDL RTL for the DS1WM block.
The RTL is located under design/vhdl_src/ds1wm.

This delivery package contains synthesizable Verilog RTL for the DS1WM block.
The RTL is located under design/verilog_src/ds1wm.

The testbench is implemented in verilog. This is located under;
   verification/verilog_src/testbench

There are testcases that demonstrates a single search rom, multiple one wire network with search rom, scratch pad integrity and an exhaustive command recognition testcases.  These testcases are located:
   verification/verilog_src/tests/single_search_rom
   verification/verilog_src/tests/multi_ow_network
   verification/verilog_src/tests/scratchpad_integrity
   verification/verilog_src/tests/cmd_recognition
   
      
Each testcase comes with a run script for users that have ncsim installed.
For usage instructions, please see the README file in the test directory.
 
Release notes and a datasheet can be found in the "doc" directory.
